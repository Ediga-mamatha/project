                    Gandhi’s campaigns sought to combat the second-class status Indians
                    received at the hands of
                    the
                    British regime.
                    Eventually, however, they turned their focus to bucking the British regime altogether, a goal that
                    was
                    attained in the years directly after World War II.
                    The victory was marred by the fact that sectarian violence within India between Hindus and Muslims
                    necessitated the creation of two independent states—India and Pakistan—as opposed to a single
                    unified
                    India.</p>

                        Gandhi’s family practiced a kind of Vaishnavism, one of the major traditions within Hinduism,
                        that
                        was
                        inflected through the morally rigorous tenets of Jainism—an
                        Indian faith for which concepts like asceticism and nonviolence are important.
                        Many of the beliefs that characterized Gandhi’s spiritual outlook later in life may have
                        originated
                        in
                        his upbringing.
                        However, his understanding of faith was constantly evolving as he encountered new belief
                        systems.
                        Leo Tolstoy’s analysis of Christian theology, for example, came to bear heavily on Gandhi’s
                        conception
                        of spirituality, as did texts such as the Bible and the Quʾrān,
                        and he first read the Bhagavadgita—a Hindu epic—in its English translation while living in
                        Britain.

                    <p style="background-color: rgb(194, 179, 163);">also known as British Raj. It lasted from 1857 to 1947.The first nationalistic revolutionary
                    movement for Indian independence emerged from Bengal. It later took
                    root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking the right to
                    appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more economic rights for
                    natives.The first half of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards self-rule by the Lal Bal Pal
                    triumvirate, Aurobindo Ghosh and V. O. Chidambaram Pillai.</p>

 Although<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857">the Indian Rebellion of
                        1857</a>
                    had shaken the British enterprise in India, it had not derailed it.
                    Until 1857, the British, especially under
                    <a href="ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Broun-Ramsay,_1st_Marquess_of_Dalhousie">Dalhousie</a> ,
                    had
                    been hurriedly building an India which they
                    envisaged to be on par with Britain itself in the quality and strength of its economic and social
                    institutions.
                    After the rebellion, they became more circumspect. Much thought was devoted to the causes of the
                    rebellion
                    and three main lessons were drawn.
                    First, at a practical level, it was felt that there needed to be more communication and camaraderie
                    between
                    the British and Indians—not just between British army officers and their Indian staff but in
                    civilian
                    life
                    as well.

                   <p style="background-color: rgb(184, 151, 127);">The Indian army was completely reorganised: units composed of the Muslims and Brahmins of the United
                    Provinces of Agra and Oudh, who had formed the core of the rebellion, were disbanded. New regiments,
                    like
                    the Sikhs and Baluchis,
                    composed of Indians who, in British estimation, had demonstrated steadfastness, were formed. From
                    then
                    on,the Indian army was to remain unchanged in its organisation until 1947.[29] The 1861 Census had
                    revealed
                    that the English population in India was 125,945. Of these only about 41,862 were civilians as
                    compared
                    with
                    about 84,083 European officers and men of the Army.[30] In 1880, the standing Indian Army consisted
                    of
                    66,000 British soldiers, 130,000 Natives, and 350,000 soldiers in the princely armies.</p>
